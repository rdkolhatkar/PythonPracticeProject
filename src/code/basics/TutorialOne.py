# Variables and Data Types in Python
age  = 25  # Integer
name = "Alice"  # String
height = 5.5  # Float
is_student = True  # Boolean
# Python is dynamically typed, so you don't need to declare data types explicitly.
print(f"Name: {name}, Age: {age}, Height: {height}, Is Student: {is_student}")
# Rules of defining variables in Python:
# 1. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
# 2. They cannot start with a number.
# 3. Variable names are case-sensitive.
# 4. Avoid using Python reserved keywords as variable names.
# 5. Use descriptive names for better readability.
# 6. Avoid using special characters or spaces and reserved keywords in variable names.
# Example of variable naming
user_name = "Bob"
user_age = 30
user_height = 6.0
is_active_user = False
# Printing the variables
print(f"User Name: {user_name}, User Age: {user_age}, User Height: {user_height}, Is Active User: {is_active_user}")
# This script demonstrates basic variable usage and printing in Python.
# It also includes comments explaining the rules for defining variables.
# Identify the variable types and print their values.
print(type(age))  # <class 'int'>
print(type(name))  # <class 'str'>
print(type(height))  # <class 'float'>
print(type(is_student))  # <class 'bool'>
# The script ends here.
# You can add more functionality or examples as needed.
